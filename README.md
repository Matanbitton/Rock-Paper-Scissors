# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Fun and simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game made with JavaScript.

I added an extra challenge for myself to only create html elements and add css styles through JavaScript.
This added an extra layer of complexity as the code began to get messy, I had to divide the code to "sections" to make it easier to read.

overall pretty fun project.
