# Rock-Paper-Scissors
a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game made with JavaScript.

I added a fun challenge for myself to only create html elements and add css styles through JavaScript.
This added an extra layer of complexity as things began to get messy, I had to divide the code to "sections" to make it easier to read.

overall pretty fun project.
